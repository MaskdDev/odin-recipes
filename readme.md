# Odin Recipes

## Why does this exist?

Odin recipes is the first project in the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) foundations course. I'm taking this course in an effort to improve my web development skills, to work on further projects in this area.

## What is it?

Odin recipes is a simple recipe viewer site written solely using HTML.
